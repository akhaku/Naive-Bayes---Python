# Naive Bayes - Python #

A Python implementation of the naive-Bayes algorithm. Written for an Algorithms
class project, and intended to be run on the Tufts Linux servers, but can be
adapted given time and effort. A custom implementation of hashtables is used
here since it was part of the requirements, but using native python dicts is
better performance-wise. 
The results will be printed to output.csv in the following order:
n,learn_time,test_time,accuracy
